# Focus

![Action Status](https://github.com/dreamilization/Focus/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

An experimental project for creating an app on iOS.

By taking advantage of Guided Access on iOS, I made this app try to keep users away from checking their phones constantly.

This app is currently aviable in the App Store
